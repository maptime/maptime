### Traditional Mapping

QGIS

- Great tutorial by Lex Berman at Harvard: http://maps.cga.harvard.edu/qgis/
- It's less of a tutorial than an entire website built to walk someone through QGIS, beginning with installation. If you've used QGIS before, or are familiar with the interface, you can start where you need to. Many sections include video.
- A Very Short Introduction to QGIS by Alan McConchie: http://mappingmashups.net/2012/11/30/a-very-short-introduction-to-qgis/
